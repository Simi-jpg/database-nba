# NBA Database Querying System

## Overview
A relational database project designed to analyze NBA player and team performance using SQL and a Java-based application interface. The system supports structured queries and full CRUD operations through a JDBC-powered backend.

## Features
- 13-table normalized relational database schema
- Complex SQL queries with joins, aggregations, and filters
- Java application interface using JDBC
- Full CRUD support for database entities

## Tech Stack
- SQL
- Java
- JDBC
- Relational Database (MSSQL)

## Architecture / Design
The database schema was collaboratively designed and normalized to reduce redundancy while supporting analytical queries. A Java application layer abstracts database interactions using object-oriented design, separating query logic from application logic.

## Setup & Usage
1. Import the database schema
2. Populate tables with NBA data
3. Run the Java application to query and modify records
